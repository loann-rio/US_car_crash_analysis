# US Accidents and Weather Events Analysis

This project analyzes US accident and weather event datasets to explore their relationship and gain insights into patterns and trends. The analysis is performed in Python using Jupyter Notebook, leveraging popular data science libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Project Objectives
- Explore the relationship between weather conditions and accident occurrences.
- Perform data cleaning to handle missing or inconsistent values.
- Generate insightful visualizations to identify trends and correlations.
- Summarize findings that could contribute to improving traffic safety and weather awareness.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing steps for both accident and weather datasets.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
- Insights into the impact of various weather conditions on traffic accidents.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `US_Accident_&_US_Weather_events.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the analysis.
4. Review the output visualizations and summaries for insights.

## Data Sources
- **US Accident Dataset**: Contains records of traffic accidents in the United States.
- **US Weather Events Dataset**: Includes historical weather events and conditions.

Ensure that the datasets are placed in the appropriate directory as specified in the notebook before running the analysis.

## Results
The notebook provides:
- A cleaned and structured dataset ready for analysis.
- Visualizations highlighting key trends, such as accident frequency during specific weather conditions.
- Observations and insights into traffic and weather interactions.
